# Motivation for writting these assays.
Learning a new discipline is easier if we can apply [Analogy-Based Learning](https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-1-4419-1428-6_11#:~:text=Learning%20by%20analogy%20is%20a,linguistic%20competence%2C%20divergent%20thinking).)

Coming from a computational background trying to decipher research papers ["Metformin treatment of diverse Caenorhabditis species reveals the importance of genetic background in longevity"](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/acel.13488) has proven to be hard.

What is Metformin? What are Caenorhabditis? Is that the optimal model? What is a model? What are the genetic role in longevity? etc...

One needs to start from [first principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle#:~:text=A%20first%20principle%20is%20a,to%20as%20postulates%20by%20Kantians.) of biology and build towards computationally tackling longevity.

Here I set out to do following things:

Define the basic biology terms needed to convey longevity information from first principles.
Frame research directions in longevity space in terms of computation.


Biology is complex. So are computers. Can we find a mapping between Software related terms and the Biology related terms? 

 Biology | Software | 
------- | -------- | 
[nucleotide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide)  ->   | [byte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte) |
[genome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome)  ->   | [bytecode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bytecode) |
[translation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_(biology)) | [disassembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disassembler) |
[protein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein)  ->   | [function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(computer_science)) |
[protein secondary structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_secondary_structure)  ->   | [basic blocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_block) |
[quaternary structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_quaternary_structure)  ->   | [compiled function with inlining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inline_expansion) |
[gene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene)  ->   | [library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_(computing)) |
[protein structure prediction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_structure_prediction)  ->   | [library identification](https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/tech/flirt/in_depth/)
[genome analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genomics#Genome_analysis)  ->   | [static analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_program_analysis) |
[molecular dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_dynamics)  ->   | [dynamic analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_program_analysis) |

While not a perfect mapping it serves a purpose. All of the problems that are going to be faced in biology domain can be tackled with already solved solutions in software.

But why do we care?

## Biology is just an iteration cycle

Solving aging entails solving biology. 


True innovation comes from finding ways to speed this iteration cycle.

Enhance 1. with high throughput screenings.

Enhance 2. with better (insilico) models.

etc.



## What gets measured gets simulated
